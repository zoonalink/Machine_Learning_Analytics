## Assignment Specification / Brief

Your report (in a form of a discussion paper) should cover the following points:

- Discuss a machine learning problem given your chosen application; identify the prob-lem, the requirements for a predictive model and its impact.
- Describe and analysis a dataset and its characteristics; size, representation and at-tributes,
- Discuss whether bivariate or multivariate analysis is most suitable for your predictive model.
- Choose/apply (a) learning algorithm(s) and identify its/their categories; supervised, un-supervised, semi-supervised.  
- Analytically evaluate your choice of machine learning solution; its suitability, cost, and apply an error evaluation metric to justify your choice, e.g., classification accuracy of classification problems, MSE and/or R^2 (R squared) for regression models, etc.  
- Choose a learning algorithm which you think is less suitable for your predictive model and justify your “rejection” reasons.

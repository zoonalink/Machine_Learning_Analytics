    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are complex organisations offering educational services to a wide and diverse student body.  HEIs have the delivery of educational success at their heart but they must also operate as viable businesses.  The sucess of a HEI is measured by the success of its students - good outcomes for students equate with success for the HEI, including financial success, improved student recruitment and retention and reputational enhancement.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Learner Analytics` is an ever growing field of research in Higher Education (HE).  HE institutions are increasingly using data to inform decision making and to improve the student experience.  In a sector report from 2017, it was found that HEIs \"working towards implementation has nearly doubled from 34% to 66%\" and that the focus has shifted \"towards retention more than learning\" (17% to 37%). (Newland, 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "This report evaluates the performance of several learning algorithms to predict student outcome using 'student engagement' data.  It explores the potential for using data to establish whether there is an opportunity for early intervention in the the case of students who are predicted to fail or withdraw.  \n"

    "\n",
    "[Open University](https://www.open.ac.uk/about/main/) is one of the world's largest distance learning providers, with over 200,000 students (Wikipedia, 2023.)  All of its teaching takes place in virtual learning environments (VLEs) and student interactions are recorded in log files.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that students to not have 'in-person' teaching as is provided by most HEIs.  Analysis and conclusions in this report cannot be diretly extended to HEIs that do provide in-person teaching - they may want to consider additional or different 'engagement' data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the analysis and conclusions are generalisable to the extend that engagement behaviour is a good predictor of student outcome and that VLEs form a critical element of modern HE teaching provision.\n",

    "\n",
    "It includes registrations for seven modules across two academic years (2013/2014 and 2014/2015) with two intake months (February and October).  In the raw data, there are 32593 student registrations from 28,785 uniqe students - 13,529 are active in 2013 and 19,064 in 2014.  \n",

    "### Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Following initial data processing and feature engineering, the dataset contains 31437 rows and 27 *potential* features.[^3] with an overall distribution of outcomes as follows - 46.6% of students passed, 31.4% withdrew and 22.0% failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Overall outcome distribution](../_images/EDA_Distribution_by_Outcome.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some analysis was done to understand the dataset, identify issues and potential features.  A selection of findings are presented below.[^4]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Students\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the distributions of outcomes by gender (M/F) and disability status (Y/N): \n",
    "\n",
    "![Distribution by gender, disability](../_images/EDA_Distribution_by_gender_disability.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "`Chi-square` tests of independence indicate that there is a statistically significant ($p<0.05$) association between both gender (moderate) and disability status (high) and final_outcome.[^5]  This was also the case when looking at a binary outcome of 'needs intervention' (fail or withdraw) vs 'does not need intervention' (pass or distinction).[^6]\n",
    "\n",
    "`Chi-square` tests for the other student characteristics (age_band, region, highest_education, imd_band) also indicate statistically significant associations with final_outcome.  The plots below show clear differences between groups in terms of outcomes, for example, students with lower 'highest_eduction' have much higher withdrawal rates, perhaps because they are less accustomed to the academic environment.  It is also notable that students have more success (pass, distinction) in the older age bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Curriculum\n",
    "\n",
    "The seven modules are from two subjects - `STEM` and `Social Sciences` - there are far more withdrawn students amongst `STEM` registrations. \n",
    "\n",
    "![outcome_by_subject](../_images/EDA_outcome_by_subject.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at outcomes by the year of study, there is a diffence in the distribution of the outomes.  Aside from there being more students in the 2014 year, there are far more students who withdraw: \n",
    "\n",
    "![outcome_by_year](../_images/EDA_outcome_by_year.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that there is a difference in average assessment scores between modules.  One can imagine that `STEM` modules are assessed differently to `Social Science` modules but the distribution should ideally be the same.  One goal is to produce a model to predict outcome on the basis of behaviour, not which module the student is registered for.  This might require building separate models for each module.  This is something to consider in future work.\n",

    "\n",
    "![outcome_by_age](../_images/EDA_outcome_by_engage.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The boxplots of engagement behaviour between the outcomes show very clearly that there is an association between the feature and the outcome.  Students who have higher average scores, click more and spend more days in the VLE have a higher chance of passing and passing with distinction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The `Kruskal-Wallis` test was used to statistically compare distributions of these continuous variables across the different final outcomes and they are all statistically significant ($p<0.05$). The null-hypothesis that the differences between outcomes are due to chance alone is rejected in favour of the alternative.[^7]  \n",

    "[^4]: Student profile exploration via unsupervised machine learning techniques like clustering were considered and explored, but are not included in this report.  Given the statistical significance between groups and outcomes, exploring 'student profile' based on characteristics, behaviour, academic history, background, or a combination could be worthwhile. This is ear-marked as a potential future project.  See XXX for notes on this.\n",
